## Testing Strategy

### Reproduction Test (Verify Bug Exists)

**Test:** `test_reproduce_[bug_name]`
```python
def test_reproduce_[bug_name]():
    """This test should FAIL before the fix, PASS after the fix."""
    # Arrange
    [setup that triggers the bug]

    # Act
    [action that causes the bug]

    # Assert
    # This assertion fails with the bug, passes with the fix
    assert [expected correct behavior]
```

### Fix Validation Tests

**Test 1: `test_[fix_scenario]`**
```python
def test_[fix_scenario]():
    # [Test that verifies the fix works]
```

**Test 2: `test_[edge_case]`**
```python
def test_[edge_case]():
    # [Test edge cases related to the fix]
```

### Regression Tests

**Test 1: `test_[related_functionality]`**
```python
def test_[related_functionality]():
    """Ensure the fix doesn't break related functionality."""
    # [Test existing functionality still works]
```

## Effort Estimation

| Activity              | Estimated Time | Assumptions |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Investigation         | [X hours]      | [Assumption 1] |
| Fix Implementation    | [X hours]      | [Assumption 2] |
| Testing               | [X hours]      | [Assumption 3] |
| Validation            | [X hours]      | [Assumption 4] |
| **Total**             | **[X hours]**  | **[Y hours/days]** |

**Key Assumptions:**
1. [Assumption affecting estimate]
2. [Assumption affecting estimate]

**Risks to Estimate:**
- [Risk 1]: Could add [X hours]
- [Risk 2]: Could add [X hours]
