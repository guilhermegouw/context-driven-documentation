title: Investigate Real-time Collaboration Technologies

research_questions:
  - What are the leading real-time collaboration libraries/frameworks available?
  - How do WebSockets compare to Server-Sent Events for our use case?
  - What are the scalability implications of each approach?
  - What would be the implementation effort for each option?
  - How do these technologies handle connection drops and reconnection?

investigation_approach: |
  1. Research and compare popular technologies:
     - Socket.io
     - WebSockets native API
     - Server-Sent Events (SSE)
     - Long polling (fallback approach)

  2. Create proof-of-concept implementations:
     - Build minimal demo with Socket.io
     - Build minimal demo with native WebSockets
     - Test with multiple concurrent connections

  3. Performance testing:
     - Measure latency with 10, 100, 1000 concurrent users
     - Test connection stability over time
     - Evaluate resource usage on server

  4. Integration assessment:
     - Review compatibility with current tech stack
     - Evaluate deployment complexity
     - Consider scalability requirements

success_criteria: |
  This spike is successful when we have:
  - A comprehensive comparison document of the technologies
  - Working proof-of-concept implementations
  - Performance benchmark results
  - Clear recommendation for which technology to use
  - Estimated implementation effort for full integration

timebox: 2 days

expected_deliverables:
  - Technical comparison document (markdown)
  - Proof-of-concept code samples
  - Performance test results
  - Recommendation document with rationale
  - Implementation roadmap estimate
