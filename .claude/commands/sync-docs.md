# sync-docs

Sync project and feature specs into Claude Code context.

## What this does

This command reads your CDD specs (project.yaml and feature specs) and provides them as context to Claude Code. This ensures Claude has up-to-date knowledge of:

- Project architecture and conventions
- Active feature specifications
- Code standards and constraints
- Testing requirements

## When to use

Run this command:
- At the start of a coding session
- After updating project.yaml or feature specs
- Before implementing a new feature
- When Claude seems unaware of project standards

## Usage

Simply run: `/sync-docs`

## Implementation

The command will:
1. Read specs/project.yaml
2. Read all specs in specs/features/
3. Format and display them in a structured way
4. Provide guidance on how to use this context
