title: Login Form Fails on Safari Browser

problem_description: |
  **Current Behavior:**
  When users try to log in using Safari browser (version 16+), the login form
  submission fails silently. The form appears to submit, but no authentication
  occurs and no error message is displayed.

  **Expected Behavior:**
  Login should work consistently across all major browsers including Safari.
  If login fails, users should see a clear error message.

reproduction_steps:
  - Open the application in Safari 16+ on macOS
  - Navigate to the login page at /login
  - Enter valid credentials (email and password)
  - Click the "Log In" button
  - Observe that the form appears to submit but nothing happens
  - Check browser console - see CORS error message

impact_assessment:
  severity: high
  affected_users: All users accessing the platform via Safari (approximately 15% of user base)
  workaround: Users can access the platform using Chrome, Firefox, or Edge browsers
