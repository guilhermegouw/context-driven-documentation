title: User Authentication System

user_story: |
  As a platform administrator,
  I want to implement secure user authentication,
  So that users can safely access their personal data and only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.

business_value: |
  User authentication is fundamental for data security and user privacy. Without proper authentication,
  we cannot protect user data or provide personalized experiences.

  Business Impact: Enables user accounts, personalization, and data privacy compliance (GDPR, etc.)

acceptance_criteria:
  - Users can register with email and password
  - Users can log in with valid credentials
  - Passwords are securely hashed and stored
  - Invalid login attempts are handled gracefully
  - Users can reset forgotten passwords via email
  - Session management keeps users logged in appropriately
  - Authentication state persists across browser sessions

implementation_scope:
  frontend:
    - Login form component with validation
    - Registration form with password strength indicator
    - Password reset flow UI
    - Session state management
  backend:
    - User registration API endpoint
    - Login authentication endpoint
    - Password hashing with bcrypt
    - JWT token generation and validation
    - Password reset token generation
    - Email service integration
  database:
    - Users table with email, hashed_password, created_at
    - Password reset tokens table
    - User sessions table

technical_considerations: |
  - Use bcrypt for password hashing (industry standard)
  - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
  - JWT tokens should expire after 24 hours
  - Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour
  - Consider implementing 2FA in future iteration
  - Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all auth endpoints
