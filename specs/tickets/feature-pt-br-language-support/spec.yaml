title: "PT-BR Language Support for CDD Framework"

user_story: |
  As a Brazilian software engineer using CDD Framework,
  I want to interact with the framework in Portuguese (PT-BR),
  So that I and my team can create documentation, specifications, and plans in our native language.

business_value: |
  Enables adoption of CDD Framework at Brazilian company by providing native Portuguese support.
  Makes the tool accessible and natural for Portuguese-speaking developers, improving their
  productivity and comfort with AI-assisted development.

  Business Impact: Unlocks Brazilian market adoption and team productivity for Portuguese speakers.

key_decisions: |
  Architecture decisions made during specification:
  - Commands stay English (cdd new, cdd init), all output in Portuguese
  - Interactive language selection during 'cdd init', stored in .cdd/config.yaml
  - Simple approach: English + PT-BR only (not full i18n framework yet)
  - Existing projects: manually edit config to switch language
  - Templates fully translated (field names AND content in Portuguese)
  - Auto-detect language from config, default to English if not set
  - Slash commands detect language and respond accordingly (single file approach)
  - File structure: translations/en.py, translations/pt_br.py, templates/en/, templates/pt-br/

acceptance_criteria:
  - [TO BE COMPLETED]
  - Interactive language selection works during cdd init
  - Config file correctly stores language preference
  - All CLI output appears in Portuguese when language: pt-br is set
  - Templates generate Portuguese content
  - Slash commands (Socrates, Plan, Exec) converse in Portuguese
  # More criteria to be added

implementation_scope:
  cli:
    - Add language selection prompt to cdd init
    - Create .cdd/config.yaml with language setting
    - Implement language auto-detection in all commands
    - Translate all CLI messages and prompts
  templates:
    - Create templates/pt-br/ directory structure
    - Translate all YAML templates (feature, bug, spike, enhancement)
    - Translate all Markdown templates (guide, feature, constitution)
    - [DECISION PENDING: Should CLAUDE.md be translated?]
  translations:
    - Create translations/en.py for English strings
    - Create translations/pt_br.py for Portuguese strings
    - Implement translation loader utility
  slash_commands:
    - Update Socrates to detect language and respond accordingly
    - Update Plan to detect language and respond accordingly
    - Update Exec to detect language and respond accordingly
    - [Other slash commands to be identified]

technical_considerations: |
  [TO BE COMPLETED IN NEXT SESSION]
  - Need to handle encoding properly for Portuguese characters (UTF-8)
  - Config file format and structure
  - Backward compatibility for existing projects without language config
  - Documentation for how to switch languages
